;;; Commentary:

;; This library aims to provide an easier method for me to work with
;; the post-processing script. At this moment what bothers me the most
;; is managing the modules that i run in the post.ini file. I will try
;; to implement a helm based approach to help me manage them more easily

;;; Code:

(require 'helm)

;; Define the modules instead of parsing them from the library so that
;; i can maintain a good running order between them as some of them
;; have inter-dependencies
